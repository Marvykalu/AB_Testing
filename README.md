# Analyze A/B Test Result

## Introduction

The processing of introducing new features on a company's website is to ensure improved performance and increased profit. However, such development may not perform as expected, then may eventually hurt your business.

A/B testing, also known as split testing, refers to an experiment technique to determine whether a new design brings improvement, according to a chosen metric.



## Objective

The objective of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. I will work through a Jupyter notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
